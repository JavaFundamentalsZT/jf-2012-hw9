Java Fundamentals 2012 - Homework 9
===========

Description
----------

We have implemented a very simple List in a file called ListApp.scala. We've also implemented some functions on the list.
There also some functions that we did not implement. These are for you to implement.

The file also contains some tests and a main method to run the tests.

Your task
----------

Go through the ListApp.scala and find the methods that don't have an implementation. Implement them. Also we want you
to write some more tests for the application. See the comments.

Happy hacking!
